## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d40fcb1e: - Bumping `material-ui/core` version to at least `4.12.2` as they made some breaking changes in later versions which broke `Pagination` of the `Table`.
  - Switching out `material-table` to `@material-table/core` for support for the later versions of `material-ui/core`
  - This causes a minor API change to `@backstage/core-components` as the interface for `Table` re-exports the `prop` from the underlying `Table` components.
  - `onChangeRowsPerPage` has been renamed to `onRowsPerPageChange`
  - `onChangePage` has been renamed to `onPageChange`
  - Migration guide is here: https://material-table-core.com/docs/breaking-changes

### Patch Changes

- 19d9995b6: Improve accessibility of core & catalog components by adjusting them with non-breaking changes.
- 224e54484: Added an `EntityProcessingErrorsPanel` component to show any errors that occurred when refreshing an entity from its source location.

  If upgrading, this should be added to your `EntityPage` in your Backstage application:

  ```diff
  // packages/app/src/components/catalog/EntityPage.tsx

  const overviewContent = (
  ...
            <EntityOrphanWarning />
          </Grid>
         </EntitySwitch.Case>
      </EntitySwitch>
  +   <EntitySwitch>
  +     <EntitySwitch.Case if={hasCatalogProcessingErrors}>
  +       <Grid item xs={12}>
  +         <EntityProcessingErrorsPanel />
  +       </Grid>
  +     </EntitySwitch.Case>
  +   </EntitySwitch>

  ```

  Additionally, `WarningPanel` now changes color based on the provided severity.

  - @backstage/theme@0.2.9

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 9a751bb28: Increase the vertical padding of the sidebar search input field to match the height of the parent anchor tag. This prevents users from accidentally navigating to the search page when they actually wanted to use the search input directly.
- 45b5fc3a8: Updated the layout of catalog and API index pages to handle smaller screen sizes. This adds responsive wrappers to the entity tables, and switches filters to a drawer when width-constrained. If you have created a custom catalog or API index page, you will need to update the page structure to match the updated [catalog customization](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/catalog-customization) documentation.
- 03bf17e9b: Improve the responsiveness of the EntityPage UI. With this the Header component should scale with the screen size & wrapping should not cause overflowing/blocking of links. Additionally enforce the Pages using the Grid Layout to use it across all screen sizes & to wrap as intended.

  To benefit from the improved responsive layout, the `EntityPage` in existing Backstage applications should be updated to set the `xs` column size on each grid item in the page, as this does not default. For example:

  ```diff
  -  <Grid item md={6}>
  +  <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
  ```

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- a446bffdb: Improve UX of the Sidebar by adding SidebarScrollWrapper component allowing the user to scroll through Plugins & Shortcuts on smaller screens. Prevent the Sidebar from opening on click on small devices
- f11e50ea7: - Enhanced core `Button` component to open external links in new tab.
  - Replaced the use of `Button` component from material by `core-components` in tools card.
- 76bb7aeda: Show scroll bar of the sidebar wrapper only on hover
- 2a13aa1b7: Handle empty code blocks in markdown files so they don't fail rendering
- 47748c7e6: Fix error in error panel, and console warnings about DOM nesting pre inside p
- 34352a79c: Add edit button to Group Profile Card
- 612e25fd7: Add custom styles to scroll bar of the sidebar wrapper to fix flaky behaviour

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- f423891ee: Fixed sizing of the System diagram when the rendered graph was wider than the container.
- 3db266fe4: Make `ErrorBoundary` display more helpful information about the error that
  occurred.

  The `slackChannel` (optional) prop can now be passed as an object on the form
  `{ name: string; href?: string; }` in addition to the old string form. If you
  are using the error boundary like

  ```tsx
  <ErrorBoundary slackChannel="#support">
    <InnerComponent>
  </ErrorBoundary>
  ```

  you may like to migrate it to

  ```tsx
  const support = {
    name: '#support',
    href: 'https://slack.com/channels/your-channel',
  };

  <ErrorBoundary slackChannel={support}>
    <InnerComponent>
  </ErrorBoundary>
  ```

  Also deprecated the prop `slackChannel` on `TabbedCard` and `InfoCard`, while
  adding the prop `errorBoundaryProps` to replace it.

- e8c65b068: Clear the previously selected sign-in provider on failure

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- d2c31b132: Add title prop in SupportButton component
- d4644f592: Use the Backstage `Link` component in the `Button`

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- e47336ea4: Use app.title for helmet in header
- 75b8537ce: This change adds automatic error boundaries around extensions.

  This means that all exposed parts of a plugin are wrapped in a general error boundary component, that is plugin aware. The default design for the error box is borrowed from `@backstage/errors`. To override the default "fallback", one must provide a component named `ErrorBoundaryFallback` to `createApp`, like so:

  ```ts
  const app = createApp({
    components: {
      ErrorBoundaryFallback: props => {
        // a custom fallback component
        return (
          <>
            <h1>Oops.</h1>
            <h2>
              The plugin {props.plugin.getId()} failed with{' '}
              {props.error.message}
            </h2>
            <button onClick={props.resetError}>Try again</button>
          </>
        );
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  The props here include:

  - `error`. An `Error` object or something that inherits it that represents the error that was thrown from any inner component.
  - `resetError`. A callback that will simply attempt to mount the children of the error boundary again.
  - `plugin`. A `BackstagePlugin` that can be used to look up info to be presented in the error message. For instance, you may want to keep a map of your internal plugins and team names or slack channels and present these when an error occurs. Typically, you'll do that by getting the plugin ID with `plugin.getId()`.
